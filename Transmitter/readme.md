# Matlab and FPGA HLS Image Transmission and Reception

This repository contains the implementation of image transmission and reception using the 802.11 waveform SDR in Matlab and FPGA HLS.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of Matlab and FPGA HLS in implementing image transmission and reception using the 802.11 waveform SDR. The example provided in the [official MathWorks documentation](https://au.mathworks.com/help/wlan/ug/image-transmission-reception-using-802-11-waveform-sdr.html) serves as the basis for this implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Matlab tool.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the [official MathWorks documentation](https://au.mathworks.com/help/wlan/ug/image-transmission-reception-using-802-11-waveform-sdr.html) to set up the required hardware and software environment.
4. Run the Matlab script `Matlab/transmitter.m` to start the image transmission process.
